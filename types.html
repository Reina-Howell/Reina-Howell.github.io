        <h2>Types of 3D printers</h2>
        <h3>SLS (selective laser sintering)</h3>
        <p>SLS uses a laser to sinter layers of powdered material to create a solid structure. The materials used in SLS range from nylon, glass, and ceramics to aluminum, silver, and even steel. It is widely used for rapid prototyping in commercial industries.</p>

        <h3>SLM (selective laser melting)</h3>
        <p>SLM is a subcategory of SLS. It uses high power lasers to melt metallic powder. Typical materials used are stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, and cobalt chrome. SLM is used to create things for aerospace or medical orthopedics.</p>

        <h3>FDM (fused deposition modeling)</h3>
        <p>FDM is used for desktop 3D printing. It uses thermoplastic filament. The printer heats the plastic and extrudes the filament through a nozzle that deposits the molten plastic. It is good for rapid prototyping in small businesses and schools.</p>

        <h3>SLA (stereolithography)</h3>
        <p> SLA exposes a layer of photosensitive liquid resin to a UV laser beam. After printing has completed the object must be rinsed with a solvent. SLA creates smooth surfaces  with extreme details. It is usually used for jewelry, and cosmetic dentistry.</p>

        <h3>CLIP (continuous liquid interface production)</h3>
        <p>CLIP is part of SLA printing. The difference is that it lies in an oxygen permeable membrane that is below the resin. The inventors claim that the process is about 100 times faster than other types of 3D printing.</p>

        <h3>DLP (digital light processing)</h3>
        <p>DLP uses a special projector to apply light and cure the resin, it is similar to SLA. Small mirrors go to back and forth to reflect light creating bright pixels. You can print layers in an instant. It is mainly used in a professional environment.</p>

        <h3>EBM (electron beam melting)</h3>
        <p>EBM uses a beam under high vacuum to melt metallic powder at 1000 degrees Celsius. This type of 3D printer can use metals like pure titanium, Inconel718, and Inconel625. It is used to fabricate Aerospace parts and medical implants. It is very slow and expensive.</p>

        <h3>LOM (laminated object melting)</h3>
        <p>LOM uses layers of adhesive coated paper, plastic, or metal, that are then fused under heat and pressure, and then shaped by cuts made with a computer-controlled laser or knife. LOM is the most affordable and fastest method to create large objects and allows full-color prints.</p>

        <h3>BJ (binder jetting)</h3>
        <p>BJ was invented at MIT. It uses a power base and bonding agent. Usually the binder is extruded in liquid form from a point head. It can print in color by adding pigments to the binder. However you won't get high-resolution prints.</p>

        <h3>MJ (material jetting)</h3>
        <p>MJ, also known as wax casting, is a technique used by jewelers for centuries. Molten rock is deposited in an aluminum build platform in layers using several nozzles. As the heated material goes into the build plate it solidifies. A different type of wax with a lower melting temperature is used as support material and melts away when put in a warm bath. The cast slowly deforms and weakens over time.</p>
