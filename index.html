<h2>Types of 3D printers</h2>

<h2>Additive and subtractive manufacturing</h2>
<p>This is an important concept in understanding what 3D printing is. Up to now almost all manufacturing has been subtractive manufacturing. <strong>Subtractive</strong> manufacturing is creating something by removing material. For example CNC machines. <strong>Additive</strong> manufacturing is making something by adding layers of material. </p>
<h2>What people are making/what 3D printers are capable of</h2>
<p>There are many things that you wouldnâ€™t expect to be 3D printed. 3D printing food is becoming popular. MIT invented a robot that can 3D print houses. In China they are 3D printing houses out of concrete. Doctors are 3D printing body parts using human cells. There are so many different things being 3D printed these days.</p>
<p> 3D printers can print complex art objects. They can also print small useful things like circuits and key holders. 3D printing is a great way to customize things.</p>
<h3>3D printed household items and hobbie items</h3>
<p>3D printing can be very useful. You can print many useful household items such as pencil holders, measuring cups, outlet plugs, vases, and many more things. 3D printers can customzie many houshold items. You can also use 3D printers just as a hobbie and make many things. You can repair things that broke, or make somethings new by designing it yourself.</p>

<h3>3D printed houses:</h3>
<p>People have noe developed a way to construct 3D printed houses. They use a large robotic arm to spray materials liek concrete from a construction nozzle.</p>

<h3>3D printed food:</h3>
<p>3D printing food can offer a range of potential benefits. It can be healthy and good for the environment because it can help incorporate alternative ingredients such as proteins from algae, beet leaves, or insects into tasty products. It is also a nice way to customize foods that wood be very difficult to make by hand.</p>

<h3>3D printed medical parts:</h3>
<p>Doctors and scientists have created a way to 3D print human organs and other body parts using living cells. 3D printed prosthetics are also very useful in the medical field. They are fully custozized to fit the wearer. It is less expensive and quicker to make.</p>

<h3>Machines 3D printed</h3>
<p>Using more complex 3D printing people have made strong machine parts. Instead of using SLA or FDM printing people use much more expeensive printers, like SLS or EBM that use different material.</p>

<h3>3D printed art:</h3>
<p>You can 3D print beautifully detailed pieces of art. There are endless possibilities.</p>

<h3>Other things 3D printed</h3>
<p>There are so many things being 3D printed, and there are so many things that can be 3D printed. A few more things that are being 3D printed are circuit board, instruments, and cars.</p>

<!--line 72 add link to SLA, FDM, EBM, and SLS.
check if it maeks sense and add. is it EBM and SLS?
add to machines and add pictures .
add pictures to other 3D prints
add discription to "places to get designs printed"
consider adding local acess like libraries for places the get things printed
add css to open link in different window
add css borders
remember to site all the images and sources-->
