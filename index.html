<h2>Types of 3D printers</h2>
<h3>SLS (selective laser sintering)</h3>
<p>SLS uses a laser to sinter layers of powdered material to create a solid structure. It is widely used for rapid prototyping in commercial industries.</p>

<h3>SLM (selective laser melting)</h3>
<p>SLM is a subcategory of SLS. It uses high power lasers to melt metallic powder. SLM is used to create things for aerospace or medical orthopedics.</p>

<h3>FDM (fused deposition modeling)</h3>
<p>FDM is used for desktop 3D printing. It uses thermoplastic filament. The printer heats the plastic and extrudes the filament through a nozzle that deposits the molten plastic. It is good for rapid prototyping in small businesses and educational places.</p>

<h3>SLA (stereolithography)</h3>
<p> SLA exposes a layer of photosensitive liquid resin to a UV laser beam. After printing has completed the object must be rinsed with a solvent. SLA creates smooth surfaces  with extreme details. It is used for jewelry, and cosmetic dentistry.</p>

<h3>CLIP (continuous liquid interface production)</h3>
<p>CLIP is part of SLA printing. The difference is that it lies in an oxygen permeable membrane that lies below the resin. The process is about 100 times faster than other types.</p>

<h3>DLP (digital light processing)</h3>
<p>DLP uses a special projector to apply light and cure the resin, it is similar to SLA. Small mirrors to back and forth to reflect light creating right pixels. You can print layers in an instant. It is mainly used in professional environment.</p>

<h3>EBM (electron beam melting)</h3>
<p>EBM it is the opposite to SLM printing. EBM uses a beam under high vacuum to melt metallic powder at 1000 degrees Celsius. It is used to fabricate Aerospace parts and medical implants. It is very slow and expensive.</p>

<h3>LOM (laminated object melting)</h3>
<p>LOM uses layers of adhesive coated paper, plastic, or metal, that are then fused under heat and pressure, and then shaped by cuts made with a computer-controlled laser or knife. LOM is the most affordable and fastest method to create large objects and allows full-color prints.</p>

<h3>BJ (binder jetting)</h3>
<p>BJ was invented at MIT. A uses a power base and bonding agent. Usually the binder is extruded in liquid form from a point head. It can print in color by adding pigments to the binder. You won't get high-resolution prints.</p>

<h3>MJ (material jetting)</h3>
<p>MJ, also known as wax casting, is a technique used by jewelers since centuries. Molten rock is deposited in an aluminum build platform in layers using several nozzles. As the heated material goes into the build plate it solidifies. A different type of wax with a lower melting temperature is used as support material and melt away when put in a warm bath. The cast slowly deforms and weakens over time.</p>

<h2>Additive and subtractive manufacturing</h2>
<p>This is an important concept in understanding what 3D printing is. Up to now almost all manufacturing has been subtractive manufacturing. <strong>Subtractive</strong> manufacturing is creating something by removing material. For example CNC machines. <strong>Additive</strong> manufacturing is making something by adding layers of material. </p>

<h2>What people are making/what 3D printers are capable of</h2>
<p>There are many things that you wouldnâ€™t expect to be 3D printed. 3D printing food is becoming popular. MIT invented a robot that can 3D print houses. In China they are 3D printing houses out of concrete. Doctors are 3D printing body parts using human cells. There are so many different things being 3D printed these days.</p>
<p> 3D printers can print complex art objects. They can also print small useful things like circuits and key holders. 3D printing is a great way to customize things.</p>

<h3>3D printed household items and hobbie items</h3>
<p>3D printing can be very useful. You can print many useful household items such as pencil holders, measuring cups, outlet plugs, vases, and many more things. 3D printers can customize many household items. You can also use 3D printers just as a hobby and make many things. You can repair things that broke, or make some things new by designing it yourself.</p>

<h3>3D printed houses:</h3>
<p>People have now developed a way to construct 3D printed houses. They use a large robotic arm to spray materials like concrete from a construction nozzle.</p>

<h3>3D printed food:</h3>
<p>3D printing food can offer a range of potential benefits. It can be healthy and good for the environment because it can help incorporate alternative ingredients such as proteins from algae, beet leaves, or insects into tasty products. It is also a nice way to customize foods that wood be very difficult to make by hand.</p>

<h3>3D printed medical parts:</h3>
<p>Doctors and scientists have created a way to 3D print human organs and other body parts using living cells. 3D printed prosthetics are also very useful in the medical field. They are fully customized to fit the wearer. It is less expensive and quicker to make.</p>

<h3>Machines 3D printed</h3>
<p>Using more complex 3D printing people have made strong machine parts. For example people are 3D printing parts for the aerospace industry. Instead of using SLA or FDM printing people use much more expensive printers, like SLS, SLM or EBM that use different material.</p>

<h3>Other things 3D printed</h3>
<p>There are so many things being 3D printed, and there are so many things that can be 3D printed. A few more things that are being 3D printed are circuit board, instruments, and cars. Engineers and builders are also using 3D printers to model building that they designed to test the strength and structure at a smaller scale.</p>
