        <h2>What people are making/what 3D printers are capable of</h2>
        <p>There are many things that you wouldnâ€™t expect to be 3D printed. 3D printing food is becoming popular. MIT invented a robot that can 3D print houses. In China they are 3D printing houses out of concrete. Doctors are 3D printing body parts using human cells. There are so many different things being 3D printed these days.</p>
        <p> 3D printers can print complex art objects. They can also print small useful things like circuits and key holders. 3D printing is a great way to customize things.</p>

        <h3>3D printed household items and hobby items</h3>
        <p>3D printing can be very useful. You can print many useful household items such as pencil holders, measuring cups, outlet plugs, vases, and many more things. 3D printers can customize many household items. You can also use 3D printers just as a hobby and make many things. You can repair things that are broken, or make some things new by designing it yourself.</p>

        <h3>3D printed houses:</h3>
        <p>People have now developed a way to construct 3D printed houses. They use a large robotic arm to spray materials like concrete from a construction nozzle.</p>

        <h3>3D printed food:</h3>
        <p>3D printing food can offer a range of potential benefits. It can be healthy and good for the environment because it can help incorporate alternative ingredients such as proteins from algae, beet leaves, or insects into tasty products. It is also a nice way to customize foods that wood be very difficult to make by hand.</p>

        <h3>3D printed medical parts:</h3>
        <p>Doctors and scientists have created a way to 3D print human organs and other body parts using living cells. 3D printed prosthetics are also very useful in the medical field. They are fully customized to fit the wearer. It is less expensive and quicker to make.</p>

        <h3>Machines 3D printed</h3>
        <p>Using more complex 3D printing people have made strong machine parts. For example people are 3D printing parts for the aerospace industry. Instead of using SLA or FDM printing people use much more expensive printers, like SLS, SLM or EBM that use different material.</p>

        <h3>3D printed fashion:</h3>
        <p>3D printing clothes is becoming more accessible. It could change the fashion industry, making it easier to recycle and create clothing. Designers can customize outfits with jewelry, prototype new ideas such as 3D printed shoes, and even 3D print an entire collection of clothing.</p>

        <h3>Other things 3D printed</h3>
        <p>There are so many things being 3D printed, and there are so many things that can be 3D printed. A few more things that are being 3D printed are circuit boards, instruments, and cars. Engineers and builders are also using 3D printers to model buildings that they designed to test the strength and structure at a smaller scale.</p>
